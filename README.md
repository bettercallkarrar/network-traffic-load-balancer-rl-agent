### 🧠 How It Works

- Incoming **network traffic** enters the environment  
- The environment computes the current **state** (load, latency)  
- The **DQN agent** selects the optimal server  
- The system returns a **reward** based on latency performance  
- The agent continuously improves decisions via **feedback loop**

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **Reinforcement Learning-based Load Balancer** that dynamically distributes network traffic across multiple servers using a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** agent.

The goal is to minimize latency and improve system efficiency by learning optimal routing decisions over time.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Reduce network congestion
* Optimize server utilization
* Minimize response latency
* Learn adaptive routing policies

---

## 🧠 Methodology

The system uses **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN)**:

* Environment simulates network traffic
* Agent observes system state (load, latency)
* Agent selects best server (action)
* Reward based on performance (latency reduction)

## ⚙️ How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train.py
python plot.py
```
