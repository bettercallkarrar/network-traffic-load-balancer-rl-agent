# 🚀 Network Traffic Load Balancer using RL Agent

---

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **Reinforcement Learning-based Load Balancer** using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent.  
The system dynamically distributes network traffic across servers to minimize latency and improve performance.

### ⚙️ How It Works

- Incoming network traffic enters the environment
- The environment computes the current state (load, latency)
- The DQN agent selects the optimal server
- The system returns a reward based on latency performance
- The agent continuously improves decisions via feedback loop

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Reduce network congestion
* Optimize server utilization
* Minimize response latency
* Learn adaptive routing policies

---

## 🧠 Methodology

The system uses **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN)**:

* Environment simulates network traffic
* Agent observes system state (load, latency)
* Agent selects best server (action)
* Reward based on performance (latency reduction)

## ⚙️ How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train.py
python plot.py
```
